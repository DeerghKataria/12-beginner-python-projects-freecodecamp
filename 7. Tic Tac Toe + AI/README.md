# Introduction
- This AI based Tic Tac Toe game uses the minimax algorithm to choose the best move for the computer player. The minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that searches all possible game states to find the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the computer player.

# How to play
- To play the game, simply run the game.py file. You will be prompted to choose whether to play as X or O. The computer player will then play as the other player.

- To make a move, simply enter the number of the square that you want to play in. The numbers are displayed on the board when you first start the game.

- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and there is no winner, the game is a tie.

# Tips for playing against the computer
- The computer player is very good at Tic Tac Toe, so it can be difficult to win against it. However, there are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning:

- Try to block the computer player's moves. If you see that the computer player is about to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonally, try to play in a square that will block their move.
- Create your own opportunities to win. If you see that you have two of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonally, try to play in the third square to win the game.
- Don't be afraid to sacrifice a square to win the game. If you see that the computer player is about to win, you can sacrifice a square to block their move and give yourself another chance to win.

# Conclusion
