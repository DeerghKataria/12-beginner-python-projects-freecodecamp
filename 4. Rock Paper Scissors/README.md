# Rock Paper Scissors Game
- This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. The game allows you to play against the computer and determines the winner based on the choices made.

# How to Play
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the rock_paper_scissors.py file using the command python rock_paper_scissors.py.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to make your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the outcome against the computer.

# Rules
1. Rock beats Scissors
2. Scissors beats Paper
3. Paper beats Rock

# Usage
- The rock_paper_scissors.py file contains the play() function, which initiates the game. Within the function, you will be prompted to enter your choice using the following key mappings:

1. 'r' for Rock
2. 'p' for Paper
3. 's' for Scissors

- After you make your choice, the program will randomly generate a choice for the computer. The game will then determine the winner based on the choices made and display the result.

- The is_win(player, opponent) function checks if the player wins based on the Rock Paper Scissors rules. It returns True if the player wins and False otherwise.

- Feel free to modify the code or add enhancements to the game as per your requirements.
