# Hangman Game
- This is a text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a list of valid English words and challenges the player to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly before losing the game.

# How to Play
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the hangman.py file using the command python hangman.py.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters and try to identify the hidden word.

# Rules
- A word is randomly chosen from a predefined list of valid English words.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
- The player can guess one letter at a time.
- If the guessed letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions.
- If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses one life.
- The player wins the game by correctly guessing all the letters in the word before running out of lives.
- The player loses the game if they run out of lives before guessing the word correctly.

# Usage
- The hangman.py file contains the hangman() function, which initiates the game. The game logic is encapsulated within this function.

- During the game, you will be prompted to enter a letter as your guess. The program will display the current state of the word, showing the correctly guessed letters and placeholders for the remaining letters.

- If your guessed letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions. If your guessed letter is not in the word, you will lose one life. The game will continue until you correctly guess the word or run out of lives.

- Feel free to modify the code or add enhancements to the game as per your requirements.

# Customization
- You can customize the game by modifying the words.py file, which contains a list of valid English words. Update the list with your desired words to make the game more challenging or themed.
